# 0 To Auto

Brought to us by team 6814 Ellipse, this series teaches one to program an FRC bot. 

Many of our bots will require some changes to their code. I will try to update this document to help us navigate those changes.

Ellipse put all of [thier code on Github](https://github.com/SeanSun6814/FRC0ToAutonomous) for us to browse. 

The main difference is that they are using the [Phoenix framework](https://api.ctr-electronics.com/phoenix/release/java/).
We use the [Rev framework](https://docs.revrobotics.com/sparkmax/).

Rev has a helpful [migration guide](https://docs.revrobotics.com/sparkmax/software-resources/migrating-ctre-to-rev).

Without further ado, here are the vids...

## [Module #1: Arcade Drive and Auto- Line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihO-mw_4Qpo&t=306s)
This is a starting point for scoring in most games. Many years, if all three robots on an alliance can do this, they get a ranking point.
### Our formula for pulses per foot is different than theirs
- The Neos have the same pulses per revolution as theirs
- We use an 11 tooth gear in our gearbox
- Our wheels are 6 inches
