# Romi Java
While we are about to enter the off-season, it may be nice for some people to continue exploring Java to work on the robot at our competitions
There are some excellent pre-made resources for both Romi and general Java Programming.

- [This is a full in-depth tutorial about how to program the Romi](https://github.com/czbeatty/FRC-Romi-Programming-Course/blob/main/Lessons/Romi%20Lesson%201%20-%20Getting%20Started.pdf)
- The [FRC 0 to Autonomous YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@0ToAuto) is the best FRC Programming Tutorial I have found. While it uses a full robot, much of it can be done with a Romi.
