## LED Matrix
We can use an LED Matrix 
I basically found two tutorials that use the same library.

-[LED Matrix as Second Screen](https://learn.adafruit.com/raspberry-pi-led-matrix-display)

This could work well with [Py Game](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted)

-[LED Matrix where you draw and refresh manually](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-rgb-matrix-bonnet-for-raspberry-pi)
